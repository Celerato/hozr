h1. Hozr

Hozr is a webbased Laboratory Information System. It provides workflows and business logic to handle the needs of medical labors.

h2. Usage

Hozr is available as Software as a Service. This means that all the maintenance task to run Hozr are outsourced. You only need web access using a modern web-browser. All traffic is encrypted and your valuable data is backed up routinely.

We try stick with the slogan 'Keep it simple, stupid'. The interface follows modern industrial design rules. All pages try to give you just enough information to do the task while being simple. Dynamic elements such as inline editing are used sparsely, but are there where appreciated.

h2. Feedback

Hozr is not the average Laboratory Informatino System. It is built using the same technologies and principles as well known internet services like Facebook, tel.search.ch or GMX. This allows very fast development and roll-out times. Every feedback, both positive and negative is very much appreciated.

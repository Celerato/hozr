# Database configuration
# ======================
# This file can be use as a template for the database.yml file.
#
# While you may use the SQLite3 database, it is tested.
#
# If you're using the SQLite3 file-based database, all you have
# to do is copy this file to database.yml.
#
# For normaly MySQL is a better fit. In this case you need to
# setup the databases and adapt this file:
#
# 1. create the database and grant access
# 3. set username and password and possibly host settings in
#    the environment config.
